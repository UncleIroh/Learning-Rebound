# Lesson 0 - The Very Basics of Python

Python is a programming langauge that is designed to very straight forward to use. To run python you will need to install it. I recommend the anaconda python package manager, it comes preinstalled with most of what we'll be using.
https://www.continuum.io/downloads. You will also need to install rebound. You can install rebound with the pip command:
```bash
pip install rebound
```

Rebound can also be found here: https://github.com/hannorein/rebound

To use python open a command prompt (windows) or terminal (mac) and type "conda install and type "python", if you installed this correctly your screen should show a >>> prompt and you can type python code directly into the termainal. This mode of writing python is mostly for testing and most coding is done in a .py file to make editting easier.

To run a .py file from your command line interfact (command prompt or terminal) you need to navigate to the directory containing the file. The basic navigation command is change directory or "cd". Here is how you use it:
```bash
cd ..
```
(go up one directory)
```bash
cd /directoryname/ 
```
(enter directory)

Once you are in the directory of a .py file you've created you type:
python filename.py
and the file with execute. That's all for now, see you in Lesson 1.
