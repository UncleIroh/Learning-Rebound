# Lesson 5 Matplotlib Basics

Matplotlib is a library for python that has a lot of graphing tools. To import the pyplot module of matplotlib type:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
Now when we type plt.show() that will be equivalent to matplotlib.pyplot.show(), this is just to save time. The key method of pyplot (or plt as we will be calling it) is .plot(). .plot() accepts two lists and a marker type. The first list is the xcords of xy cords and the second list of a list of y cords. The marker type is how the pts appear on the graph.
